# Smart EV Charging Optimization 🚗⚡

This project simulates **smart charging management** for multiple electric vehicles (EVs) using MATLAB.  
It demonstrates how coordinated charging can reduce **grid peak load** while ensuring that all EVs reach their target state of charge within the available time.

## 🔹 Project Overview
Uncontrolled EV charging can cause sudden spikes in power demand, stressing the grid and increasing operational costs.  
This simulation introduces a **smart charging controller** that dynamically distributes available power among EVs, respecting the grid's maximum capacity.

---

## 🧰 Features
- Multi-EV charging simulation (random initial and target SOC)
- Grid power limit management
- Dynamic power allocation to EVs
- Comparison between uncontrolled and smart charging
- Visualization of SOC and power distribution

---

## 📊 Results
The results clearly show:
- **Reduced grid peak load** under smart charging
- **Smoother load profile**
- **Fair power allocation** among EVs
